\section*{Acceptable Usage}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Any function provided as part of a language's standard library
  \item Any piece of code that was provided to you by the instructor
  \item Any piece of code that you wrote as part of a lab, hack session or from another assignment
  \item Any piece of code \emph{you} wrote outside of class or for another class
  \item ?? Sharing your code with others \emph{after all possible due dates have passed} in order to learn and understand may be acceptable
\end{itemize}

\section*{Unacceptable Usage}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Any piece of code copied (in any form, cut-and-paste of any part, copying entire files or transcribing or reproducing code you saw from another student's copy
  \item Providing code to another student or allowing another student to copy your code or not taking reasonable measures to prevent another student from gaining access to your code
  \item Making your code publicly accessible prior to final grades posting
  \item Accessing sites such as:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \url{http://www.chegg.com}
    \item \url{http://coursehero.com}
    \item \url{https://www.freelancer.com/} 
  \end{itemize}
  or anything similar will result in immediate failure of this course.  These
  are sites whose only purpose is to facilitate cheating and have no other 
  legitimate use as far as this course goes.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Don't Be Stupid}

It is \textbf{stupid to cheat} because:
\begin{itemize}
  \item You're not learning anything, you're wasting your money and your time 
  \item Your ignorance will eventually be exposed, either in your exams, future courses, or career; fail fast or fail slow.
\end{itemize}

It is stupid to \textbf{ask for or receive code from someone else} because
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you use it to any significant degree, it will be easily detected using MOSS.
  \item You undermine your own learning experience
  \item If they were willing to share it with you, they likely shared it with others, increasing nearly guaranteeing the likelihood that you will all get caught.
\end{itemize}

It is stupid to \textbf{give your code to someone else} because
\begin{itemize}
  \item They will likely end up screwing you by using it either in part or in whole which will easily be caught using MOSS.  You will suffer the consequences along with them.  You risk everything and gain nothing.
  \item They may share it with any number of other students, almost guaranteeing that you will all get caught.
\end{itemize}

It is stupid to \textbf{copy code off the internet} because
\begin{itemize}
  \item Your instructor can use Google too, you know.  We can just as easily find the source of your plagiarism and in fact can do it easier because we have your copy!
  \item Several other idiots may have the exact same bright idea!  Multiple students copying from the same source is going to be at the top of our red flag list when we run MOSS.
\end{itemize}
