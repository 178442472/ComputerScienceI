\section*{Introduction}

Hack session activities are small weekly programming assignments intended
to get you started on full programming assignments.  Collaboration is allowed
and, in fact, \emph{highly encouraged}.  You may start on the activity before
your hack session, but during the hack session you must either be actively 
working on this activity or \emph{helping others} work on the activity.
You are graded using the same rubric as assignments so documentation, style, 
design and correctness are all important.  This activity is \textbf{due 
at 23:59:59 on the Friday} in the week in which it is assigned according 
to the CSE system clock.

\section*{Problem Statement}
In this hack you'll get more practice using the Gnu Debugger (GDB). You have been provided with a program that should be able to play perfect
games of tic tac toe. However, it contains several bugs that stop it from working correctly. Using GDB, find the parts of the code causing the program
to crash or malfunction and fix them.

Although you are free to analyze them if you are wondering how they work, there are no bugs in aiMove() or bestMoveFinder() in tictactoeUtils.c. 

\section*{Instructions}
All necessary files are already included in the hack9.0-files folder. Hand in the repaired files using webhandin.
\begin{itemize}
  \item You are encouraged to collaborate any number of students 
  before, during, and after your scheduled hack session.  
  \item Design at least 3 test cases \emph{before} you begin
  designing or implementing your program.  Test cases are 
  input-output pairs that are known to be correct using means
  other than your program.
  \item Include the name(s) of everyone who worked together on
  this activity in your source file's header.
  \item Name your program \mintinline{text}{TODO.c}, and
  turn it in via webhandin, making sure that it runs and executes
  correctly in the webgrader.  Each individual student will need
  to hand in their own copy and will receive their own individual
  grade.
\end{itemize}
